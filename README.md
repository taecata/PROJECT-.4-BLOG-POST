Blog post: on connecting things

http://www.electronicsunset.org/node/310

This piece by Hollington & Kyprianou called Aristotle's Office is a piece that uses the Internet of things to make different office objects interact with each other sending signals. All the objects are connected to a sort of console, and by being connected to it can detect changes in the physical movements of all the other objects. The objects are ordinary - a fan, a filing cabinet, a lamp - and have lives of their own. It's funny to see them interact as if they were people in an office, something reacting violently to certain movements made by others. I like the piece because of its seeming cartoon-like nature of the objects and their interactions. It gives an almost post-apocalyptic feel in which no humans exist and objects develop their own mode of existence.

The other piece that I found really exciting was a piece called Nervous Structure by two artists called Cuppetelli and Mendoza. The piece is a video projection of some white lines or strings and they are connected to the movement of the viewer. If the viewer moves their hand over the strings, the projection moves as if the strings were part of analog life. The coordination of the artwork and the human interacting with it is so perfect that it seems like it obeys the laws of nature more perfectly than analog strings would. The artwork presents an extremely harmonious and seamless interaction between human and 'computer'.
