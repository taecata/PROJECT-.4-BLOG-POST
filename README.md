Blog post: on connecting things

http://www.electronicsunset.org/node/310

This piece by Hollington & Kyprianou called Aristotle's Office is a piece that uses the Internet of things to make different office objects interact with each other sending signals. All the objects are connected to a sort of console, and by being connected to it can detect changes in the physical movements of all the other objects. The objects are ordinary - a fan, a filing cabinet, a lamp - and have lives of their own. It's funny to see them interact as if they were people in an office, something reacting violently to certain movements made by others. I like the piece because of its seeming cartoon-like nature of the objects and their interactions. It gives an almost post-apocalyptic feel in which no humans exist and objects develop their own mode of existence.

The other piece that I found really exciting was a piece called Nervous Structure by two artists called Cuppetelli and Mendoza. The piece is a video projection of some white lines or strings and they are connected to the movement of the viewer. If the viewer moves their hand over the strings, the projection moves as if the strings were part of analog life. The coordination of the artwork and the human interacting with it is so perfect that it seems like it obeys the laws of nature more perfectly than analog strings would. The artwork presents an extremely harmonious and seamless interaction between human and 'computer'.  

PROJECT 4 
Theatre of Constraint (2018) 

The initial concept of this piece was to transform the screen into a theatre in which the reactions from the public surprise the person "performing". The piece is a series of videos of the person looking at the screen, and when the camera detects certain movements in the person's face, there are extremely hysterical, theatrical and almost unpleasant sounds that begin. Some emojis from Facebook also appear on the screen - as a way of classifying the emotion that the person is supposedly portraying. The point of this user interaction is that the person does not actually know what exactly is causing these sounds, and has to constrain their facial movements in order to not have to listen to excruciating sounds. In this way, I wanted to mimic the way in which we perform online especially on social media platforms like Facebook. We are both required (socially) to act on Facebook in relation to the 'social' aspect of it (performing under the gaze of other people) and the 'media' aspect which is to become algorithmically recognizable. In both instances, our actions and posts online can become misinterpreted and, at least in my experience, I feel like it is better to not post anything at all. Hence, the theatre of constraint in which you would rather stand still and observe in order to not create a commotion. Another aspect of the project that I wanted to add was a loud applause that would play once there is no face detected. The concept behind this would be that at that moment the user would want to stay in order to experience the applause, but as soon as they turn back to face the 'public' the applause would stop - this sound acts like a luring back into the theatre of constraint.
